A hyper-local marketplace connecting small sellers with buyers to rescue expiring goods, reduce food waste, and save money.


## üéØ Problem Statement

Every day, small local stores, bakeries, and grocers are forced to throw away perfectly good food that is nearing its expiry date. This results in significant financial loss for the sellers and a massive environmental impact from food waste. At the same time, consumers are always looking for ways to save money on quality goods. ResQMart bridges this gap by creating a win-win platform for both sellers and buyers.
